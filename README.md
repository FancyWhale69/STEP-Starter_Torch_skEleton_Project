## Motivation
Starting a new project is an exciting thing but sadly you will have to waste your time building the basic code from scratch (╯°益°)╯彡┻━┻.   
But worry not for I came to save the day  ╰( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )つ──☆*:・ﾟ .   
with this project I aim to create a complete basecode skeleton for starting a deeplearning project with pytorch, all you have to do is concentrate on building your awesome model and leave the basic things to me ☆⌒(≧▽​° ).

## Features
- Model skeleton.
- Dataloader skeleton.
- Basic train/test Split of Dataloader. 
- Basic train function.
- Basic evaluation function.
- offline logs.
- online logs (using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site)).
- saving model after each epoch.

## Future Work
- Use pytorch lightining wrapper.
- Multi-GPU support.
- Basic utils functions.
- Multi-thread skeleton.
- Custom Loss skeleton.
- Starter Colab notebook.
- there's a nice repo for finetuning almost any [LLM](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/blob/main/src/axolotl/cli/train.py)


## Final Remarks
If you love the project and would like to contribute don't be shy and make a pull request with your additions, and if you find useful please don't forget to star it (⌒▽⌒)☆.  
If you wanna talk shoot me a message on [linkedin](linkedin.com/in/hazim-bukhari).  
  
NOTE: The code is under development and will be refined with time, I appreciate any input and thank you for using my project m(_ _)m.
